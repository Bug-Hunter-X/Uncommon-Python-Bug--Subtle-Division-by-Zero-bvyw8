# Uncommon Python Bug: Subtle Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Python related to division by zero.  The code appears to handle the case where the input is zero, but it fails to address scenarios with extremely small numbers or incorrect input types.  The solution provided enhances the error handling for better robustness.

## Bug Description

The `my_function` divides 1 by the input `x`. While it explicitly checks for `x == 0`, it doesn't account for cases where `x` is near zero or of an inappropriate type. This leads to a `ZeroDivisionError` or a `TypeError` that the user does not expect. 

## Solution

The solution introduces comprehensive input validation and error handling to prevent unexpected exceptions.
